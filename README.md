This is just a temporary repository to write the 'minimal representation of a variant' code for xbrowse
We'll wrap this up into xbrowse when we're comfortable with the result. 

Two files: 

- minimal_representation.py is the actual application code. 
I think only one function is necessary but feel free to add more if necessary. 

- test_minimal_representation.py is for unit tests. 

Run the test with:

	python test_minimal_representation.py 

This has no dependencies - just Python 2.7

One option is to use "test driven development" here. 
It's a good exercise, but I probably wouldn't because of the overhead - up to you. 
But we do need tests.
